      <%= @user.name %>, your Action has been running for <%= @days %> days. Unfortunately you did not reach your goal amount, but the great news is that you raised a total of $<%= @project.total_contributions %>. Would you like to end your compaign now and receive your funds, or continue to let it grow?
