  <p>Compassion for Humanity, Inc. is a new start up charitable organization.  Compassion for Humanity, Inc. desires to help those who are in need through new fundraising technology known as Crowdfunding.

The definition of Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to raise money for all types of things. Crowdfunding makes use of the easy accessibility of vast networks of friends, family and colleagues through social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to get the word out about a cause and attract donations. </p>
