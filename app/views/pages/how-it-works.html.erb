  <h4>Step 1: Create Your Cause Page</h4>
<p>Compassion for Humanity is deeply committed and dedicated to helping you raise capital for your cause. The best advice we can give is to tell a compelling story full of truth, emotion, and be very descriptive about the small things. Open the window for people to see inside, the more you share the more people will feel like they are a part of the story. The more insight you can share about the beneficiary and their current situation, the better. People want to know the whole story, so more is better, don’t be vague.</p>
<p>Bring your cause to life by uploading pictures and video to help others see where Compassion is needed. Most people’s greatest concern is what their donation will be used for. Be very descriptive; let them know exactly what their donation will be used for, and how it will make a difference in the life of the beneficiary. Also, you need to keep your supporters interested and up-to-date by frequently posting on your fundraiser’s blog.</p>
<p>During the set up process, you will be prompted to list any related vendors needing payment (doctors, funeral homes, Pharmacies, anesthesiologists, hospitals, adoption agencies, laboratories, prosthetics, wheelchairs, etc…) and their contact information, along with copies of any invoices needing to be paid. The IRS will not allow us to pay the beneficiary directly, due to the possibility of fraud. This process of Compassion for Humanity paying vendors directly also increases the integrity of the cause and the trust of potential donors. Any cause trying to generate funds for the hungry or presents for children will be paid out with gift cards from a local grocery / shopping center of your choice (example- Walmart, Target or Toys R Us). If your cause is construction related, Compassion will pay the Approved Contractor directly, there is no need for you to list anything, just select one of our Approved Contractors in your area. If your cause is Missions, Faith or Church related payment can be made directly to the organization.</p>
<p>If your cause includes any type of construction from roofing to remodeling or plumbing to electrical, you will be prompted to select one of Compassion for Humanity’s Approved Contractors in your area to assist in the project. Compassion for Humanity sets a very high standard to be an “Approved Contractor” in our network. You can rest assured that Compassion for Humanity, has thoroughly investigated each and every one of our Approved Contractors and they are qualified to help in your construction.</p>
<p>It is very important that you search through each contractors profile page, look at their previous work, maybe even contact them by phone, read their reviews and select the one you feel best meets your needs. Once you select an Approved Contractor, you will not be able to change. </p>
<p>When an Approved Contractor is selected that contractor and an independent third party adjuster shortly thereafter will contact you, to schedule an inspection at the property. Together both the adjuster and the contractor will create an agreed upon scope of repairs and an agreed upon estimate for the repairs. This process sometimes takes a few days (5-7) to complete so, please be patient. </p>
<p>Once the agreed upon scope of repairs and the agreed upon estimate for the repairs is completed it will then be uploaded into your causes site as a PDF along with before pictures of the property for others to review. There will be an invoice created for the adjuster’s services, it and any inspection invoices, will be paid out of the first donations received from your cause. The invoices are based upon the scope of work needed and the amount of time it takes to complete the estimate, usually the invoices are no more than $250 to $350 and inspections are usually no more than $150. When this is done, your cause will then be activated for others to see and you can move on to sharing it with others. </p>
<h4>Step 2: Spread the Word</h4>
<p>CompassionforHumanity.org makes easy use of the vast networks of friends, family and colleagues through social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to get the word out about a cause and attract donations. Supporters can donate online using a credit card, debit card, and other methods. There is nothing easy about raising money. Asking for help can be one of the hardest things a person will ever do. Compassion for Humanity has and is working tirelessly to simplify and improve the process. </p>
<p>Start by spreading the word to all your personal contacts, neighbors, close friends, and family. The people that know you or the beneficiary best are likely to be early supporters and will help share the cause. By sharing your story or someone else’s, on CompassionforHumanity.org, people will be inspired to help, and in return they will share your story with their family and friends. Remember to keep your supporters interested and up-to-date by frequently posting on your fundraiser’s blog. Before you know it you will start to see real progress and get closer to your goal.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Celebrate</h4>
<p>Once your cause reaches its goal amount, Compassion for Humanity will process and send the funds via check or transfer. Our goal is always to get your funds to you as quickly as possible, however this process can take up to 7 business days. If your cause is construction related we will pay draws directly to the selected contractor.  Any and all fees or charges from credit card processing, inspections, and adjusters will be withheld and or paid. There will also be a small processing fee of 5% payable to Compassion for Humanity. Any monies raised above and beyond your set Goal will be placed into a benevolence account and used to help Compassion for Humanity help other in need.</p>
<p>Payment Security</p>
<p>There’s no need to worry when creating or donating to a fundraiser. Compassion for Humanity uses the latest encryption technology to ensure every donation is secure and private. We never give out your contact information, unless you decide you want to share it with the beneficiary. Additionally, we never sell information about our donors, so you don’t have to worry about future soliciting.</p>
